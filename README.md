Given a scenario and an interface, we were tasked with determining a new color palette for a bus operator interface for the Potsdam Transportation Company to help their colorblind operators achieve lower reaction times and increase accuracy. Data was collected into an Excel sheet which was analyzed to determine the validity of the new color palette in comparison to the old deployed. Need-finding interviews were done with our professor, as he is colorblind.
